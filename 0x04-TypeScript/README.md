TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft, designed to enhance the development experience by adding optional static typing, interfaces, and other features that improve code quality, readability, and maintainability. It compiles to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any environment that runs JavaScript, while offering developers the benefits of early error detection and powerful tooling support. TypeScript is particularly useful in large-scale projects where maintaining clean and manageable code is critical, as it enables better code structuring and error handling before runtime.
