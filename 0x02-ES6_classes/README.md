ES6 classes introduce a more structured and familiar syntax for creating and working with objects in JavaScript, offering a clearer approach to object-oriented programming. They allow for the definition of a class with a constructor method for initializing objects, and additional methods can be added directly within the class body without the need for the function keyword. Classes support inheritance through the extends keyword, enabling one class to inherit properties and methods from another, while static methods can be defined on the class itself for utility functions. ES6 also includes features like getters and setters to control property access and modification, and private fields (denoted by #) to encapsulate data, making it inaccessible from outside the class. These enhancements make JavaScript more powerful and maintainable, especially for developers accustomed to object-oriented paradigms in other languages.
