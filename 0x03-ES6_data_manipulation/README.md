ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced powerful features for data manipulation in JavaScript, allowing developers to write more concise and readable code. Key features include arrow functions for cleaner syntax, destructuring assignment for easy extraction of values from arrays and objects, and the spread/rest operator (...) for flexible array and object handling. Additionally, ES6 offers new methods for arrays, such as map, filter, and reduce, which enable more functional and expressive data transformations. These enhancements make ES6 an essential tool for modern JavaScript development, significantly improving the efficiency and clarity of data manipulation tasks.
